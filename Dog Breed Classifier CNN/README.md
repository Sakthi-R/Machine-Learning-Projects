## Dog-Breed-Classifier using CNN and transfer learning in PyTorch

### Project Overview
<p align="justify">
Objective is to build a machine learning model that will be accessed by the 
Web Application to process real-world, user-supplied images. The problem is to identify a dog if dog image is given as input, if supplied an image of a human, we have to identify the resembling dog image. </p>

### Dog images dataset:

Below are the dog images split up
test Images   : 836
valid Images :835
train Images : 6680
Total Images : 8531

Dog images varies with size and background.
 
### Human images dataset:

Total Images : 13233
All the images are 250X250 pixel size and 96 dpi resolutions.
Total Folders : 5750
Single image can have one human face or multiple human face as well.
